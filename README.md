# Cyclistic_Case_Study
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Introduction
To complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have completed a Capstone Project highlighting some of the technical skills (Excel, SQL and Tableau) I learned during the course. I chose to analyze the Case Study 1 for my Capstone Project which is the 'Cyclistic Case Study'.

## Background
Cyclistic is a bike-share program based in Chicago that features 5824 bicycles and 692 stations spread around Chicago. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. At the moment they offer bikes for use to two customer segments: Casual Riders (Casual) and Annual Members (Member).
The marketing department has been tasked with creating a campaign aimed at converting Casuals to Annual Members. 
To help them complete this business task, the marketing team has assigned me with answering the following question "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
