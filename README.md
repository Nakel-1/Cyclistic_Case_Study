# Cyclistic_Case_Study
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Introduction
To complete the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have completed a Capstone Project highlighting some of the technical skills (Excel, SQL, Tableau) I learned during the course. I chose to analyze the Case Study 1 for my Capstone Project which is the 'Cyclistic Case Study'.

## Background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago which offers over 6000 bikes at 800+ docking stations spread around Chicago. At the moment they offer bikes for use to two customer segments: Casuals and Members.
The marketing department has been tasked with creating a campaign aimed at converting Casuals to Annual Members. 
To help them complete this business task, the marketing team has assigned me with answering the following question "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"
